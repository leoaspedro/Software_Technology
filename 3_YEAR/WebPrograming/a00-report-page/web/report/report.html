<h2>Part 00 - A00</h2>

<p> <strong>1.Computer Development Environment</strong></p>
<p>ASUS Laptop - Windows 10</p> 
    <p>Visual Studio Code - Code in HTML and CSS</p>
    <p>Git & GitLab - Using the Terminal from GitBash to push and pull files</p> 
    
    <p> <strong>2.Git/GitLab/Markdown</strong></p>
    <p>In the past 2 years I have used Git and GitLab to work on project courses so I already have some basic knowledge with it.</p> 
    <p>I am not familiar with Markdown though. </p>

    <p> <strong>3.Web Development Projects</strong></p>
    <p> <i>First Year Project - Online Byke Shop</i></p>
    <p>In my first year me together with 9 people developed an online byke shop using Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS , Git & GitHub where we recreated a website to shop for bykes using FireBase from Google as our database. </p>

    <p><i>Second Year Project - Menseger App</i></p>
    <p>In the second year me and a group of 3 people did a menseger app, so no website but we still used HTML, CSS and Git/GitLab.</p>

    <p> <strong>4.Web Development Skills</strong></p>
    <p>When it comes to web developing all I have done was always meant for my diploma courses so basically what I mentioned before is my knowledge, during this projects I have done more GUI then database/routing type of work so I m probably more comfortable with GUI frameworks and doing the User Interfaces but looking forward to improving my web developing skills in all the aspects.</p>

    <p> <strong>5.TIL</strong></p>
    <p>Work on every aspect of the website and learning Markdown</p>

<h2>Part 01 - A01</h2>
<p><strong>1. Did you know and had used HTML and CSS before this assignment?</strong></p>
In past years I have used both HTML and CSS in the project courses, but I was always going through internet tutorials or youtube videos to learn the basics.
This time I already knew it better and had a better approach to the course and the languages used for coding.

<p><strong>2. Briefly explain, with your own words, about HTML to a person who has never heard of it before.</strong></p>
HTML is a web programming language that takes care of the User Interface and how everything is displayed in the browser.


<p><strong>3. Briefly explain, with your own words, about CSS to a person who has never heard of it before.</strong></p>
CSS is a web programming language that takes care of the HTML style, so all the style sheets and all the customization for the interface is done in CSS.

<p><strong>4. Elaborate on the importance of keeping HTML (markup and content) and CSS (style and layout) as two separate items. Is it important and in that case why? Can it be completely separated or do they somehow depend on each other?</strong></p>
Having these two items separated is important because like you mentioned, HTML is used for markup and content while CSS is doing the style and layout of content on the website, so for functionality, productivity and efficiency having them apart is a key factor. Having the ability to styling in CSS and then being able to use it in any of the HTML files is a real lifesaver.
I would say CSS is dependent on HTML because if we never call the style sheets into the HTML page, the HTML will still work fine and the CSS page will be useless.


<p><strong>5. What is your first impression of JavaScript as a programming language?</strong></p>
My first impression is that is Java but with less constrains, you can code more sloppily I would put it like that, but nice language especially for web programming where we don't need to complicate things.



<p><strong>6. Can you compare JavaScript as a programming language with other languages you know? Do you see equalities and differences?</strong></p>
JavaScript compared to Java is pretty much the same concepts but with less range, Javascript doesn't have that many options when it comes to variable types, libraries, etc.. but it keeps the fundamentals of Java so that is handy.

<p><strong>7. What is your opinion about the popularity of JavaScript? Can you see why it became popular or do you think that its popularity is overestimated? In your humble opinion?</strong></p>
Before I learned javascript I did not know much about it asides from the relation to Java but when I discovered that javascript was used in web programming, immediately make sense to me why it got so popular, its just an easy way of coding and it suits well together with CSS and HTML.


<p><strong>8. Describe how you opted to organise your JavaScript code in the assignment.</strong></p>
My javascript code is organized in two functions, one that takes care of the first game (Word Randomizer) and for the second one (Guessing Game) and outside of that is just a bunch of print outs in the console and the calls to show it in HTML.

<p><strong>9. What is your TIL for this course part?</strong></p>
My TIL for this assignment was the javascript since I have never coded in this language and I found it cool in how it connects with HTML.

<h2>Part 02 - A02</h2>

<p><strong>1. Explain how the scope works in JavaScript, how hoisting affects it and how a closure works.</strong></p>
In Javascript the scope determines the accessibility of variables, this means if you define a variable inside a function you will not be able to access it from outside the function but for example, if you declare a global variable ( using {}) you can access it everywhere in your code, despite being vulnerable to bugs, that's why you should always declare local variables.
In Javascript you should always declare your fucntions before you use them so it gets hosted properly.
A closure is when you have a function within another function, so the closure will be the inner function.

<p><strong>2. What are your thoughs on the module design pattern and the prototype object model?</strong></p>
I really liked the module design since it was low key similar to java system when creating the variables, functions and how you access them, so yeah pretty satisfied with the way the module pattern works. On the other hand, when it comes to the prototype object model, I looked into it just to know what it was and I tried to use it but I found more difficulties and because I was previously coding in java the module design pattern just made more sense for me.

<p><strong>3. Describe how you opted to organise your JavaScript code in the assignment and your observations and learnings from your code structure.</strong></p>
In this assignment we had to do two parts, the first one, hangman I was coding and organising the code like I always do when programming in Java, except in Javascript I was using the module design pattern that follows a similar style.
Secondly, the quiz part is organised in two scripts, one of them is the modules that work like functions out the main class, but here you have to export them to be able to access it outside, and the other one is the main script for the quizz so it looks similar to the class system in java but with some javascript adaptations.

<p><strong>4. How do you feel about asynchronous programming in JavaScript, can you relate it to some other programming you done previously?</strong></p>
I think asynchronous programming in JavaScript is really handy since for the quiz part we had to get the answer from the client and check it with the server and only then the function would move on since it was waiting for it. The way I did it was just like the teacher showed on the lecture, following the function->then.->catch. In past courses I also worked with asynchronous proggraming when doing the TCP server/client in Computer netwroks where we also have to wait for the response to proceed. 

<p><strong>5. Elaborate on the lint (test) and build sequence of your code. Do you see pros and cons and can you relate it other development work you have done?</strong></p>
I used linters and minifiers in the hangman part of the assignment, and the way lint (test) works is it goes through the whole code looking for vulnerabilities in the code to prevent human (rational) errors that some times programmers have a hard time to understand and catch those errors so it is indeed a good tool to use when coding.
And the build just means the minifiers are gonna clean up the code, taking out blank spaces, clearing unnecessary spaces or comments, compressing the whole code in the least size possible, making it easier and faster to deploy.

<p><strong>6. What is your TIL for this course part?</strong></p>
My TIL for this assignment was basically the whole quizz part because everything I was doing was new and had to follow the lectures to really understand what was happening, in the other hand the hangman was pretty straight forward as I did it in java in previous java course.

        <h2>Part 03 - A03</h2>
        <p><strong>1. For each feature (F1, F2 and so on) you have implemented, write a 5-10 sentences text about it and let the teacher know how you solved it. This is essential. There is no grade if you fail to write about the features.?</strong></p>
        <strong>F1: PWD Functional requirements</strong>
            <p>Starting this assignment was hard, I mean, it seemed a lot at the beginning since I had no clue how to make a Personal Web Deskop.</p>
            <p>After some research and failed attempts I started by doing the basic mechanics of the PWD work, making the windows draggable and making the whole desktop look smooth. The windows focus part was one of the latest things I did but was good since it made my code look better and simpler.<p>

            <strong>F2: PWD Non functional requirements</strong>
            <p>As in the other assignments I was already used to use git and committing changes frequently, including using the ES modules and linters to make the code look better. <p>

            <strong>F3: Memory game window application</strong>
            <p>The memory game I would say was the second easiest part of the assignment, where the basic mechanic behind it is cool, and despite me using colours we can easily change it in the CSS style to images, but yeah overall was not that hard, some issues occurred but at some point, everything clicked. I also included a trial tracker so the player how many tries he needed to finish the memory game. In this game, you have the option of playing 2x2,2x4 and 4x4. <p>

            <strong>F4: Chat window application</strong>
            <p>In my opinion, this one was the tricky and hardest one for me despite already having the server working and in assignment 2 we worked a bit with that mechanic behind it, but I guess for me this type of exercises are just not that funny. The chat includes all the requirements where you can talk to anyone who is connected to the secret server provided by the teacher. <p>

            <strong>F5: An additional window application</strong>
            <p>I decided to create a basic dice randomiser application where you roll the dice and have a counter for each of the rolled faces. This one was my first feature done on the whole desktop so was good I chose a simple thing where I could learn how everything related and worked so when I went to do the other features I was way more comfortable. <p>


            <p><strong>2. Write a concluding text, 5-10 sentences, about your implementation of the project. Write about hard/easy, troubles/solutions, and so on, things you encountered and thought of during the project and its implementation.</strong></p>
            I think overall this assignment was hardish, where it took a lot of time to learn and get it actually done but still fun when you see the final result. I struggled the most with the chat but eventually, I asked help to some friends and worked a bit more in how the information flows and got it done. In this assignment, I learned a lot on how to detect issues and correct them using the inspect element in the browser so yeah super handy.
            <p><strong>3. What is your TIL for this course part?</strong></p>
            My TIL for this part of the course was the chat application since I don't like how we have to send a message, get information and connect it to the server, but that is just my personal opinion.
            <p><strong>4. Write a final summary of your thoughts on this course. Did you enjoy it or not, did you learn anything/something/a lot. Let the teacher know your thoughts of the course and grade it by a scale 1-10 where 10 is "quite a good course" and 1 is "not so good".</strong></p>
            I think this course teaches a lot of nice and useful this for the future, I loved the first assignment and now with the knowledge we have the from next assignments we can build a well-rounded web site so yeah really glad I had this course. I would give it 8 out of 10.
            <p><strong>5. What is your overall TIL for this course?</strong></p>
            My TIL for the whole course I would say is everything related to the Server part, where we need to fetch and send data across.
