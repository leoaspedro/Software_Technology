The Mondraker Foxy Carbon R has revolutionized the MTB world with its innovative forward geometry. The long top tube and short stem make the bike stable and easy to handle in steep and technical terrain, yet remains a great climber.The new Foxy Carbon combines the best and most advanced technologies and is the greatest development a model has ever undergone in its technical features. The design represents an exceptional breakthrough: The front triangle has a more stylized layout with thinner tubes; the top tube is flatter in profile for more speed and less wear.weight, while at the same time improving stiffness. Finally, the rear section has been completely renewed and equipped with a structurally reinforced swingarm. It is the first model to be offered by Mondraker in both Stealth Carbon and Stealth Air Carbon, the latter being the state-of-the-art and exclusive RR SL version. The zero suspension system has been fully optimized so that the newly conceived rear suspension now offers superior performance. It is the first model with Metric damper and Trunnion mount, and probably the model where Mondraker's developers spent most of their time developing and testing prototypes with different kinematic configurations until they finally had the best performance. The more compact rear suspension is equipped with new 15mm swinging thru axles and larger bearings. Thanks to its new kinematics, structural and technological upgrades and 150mm of increased travel, the damping has improved exponentially without becoming more spongy at the start. This makes the new Foxy even more versatile and powerful, with exceptional rear suspension and a unique Foxy Carbon experience.In addition, Mondraker's guys have developed the Forward Geometry so that the Foxy Carbon remains the flagship model. They have concentrated on maintaining a balanced geometry and now offer the possibility to adjust the steering angle by 1° and the chain stay length by 10 mm - both functions have been taken directly from the Summum Carbon and Dune Carbon. The Forward Geometry is based on the same geometry standard used on longer tubes with shorter stems (30mm) as the 2013 concept. Having optimised this season for season, it now features minor improvements and enhancements that set Mondraker apart from the rest.Zero Suspension SystemThe Zero Suspension System is a dual-link design in which the damper floats between the two suspensions and is compressed from both sides. This makes the rear suspension extremely sensitive to small shocks and large shocks.The main advantages of Zero Suspension technology are zero power loss - an absolutely stable ride while pedaling, zero pedal rebound, minimal chain impact, isolated braking and damping forces and what Mondraker call Zero Bumps its great ability to absorb any kind of shock, allowing the rear wheel to efficiently maintain the necessary grip on the ground.Forward GeometryThe main advantages of forward geometry are increased safety and self-confidence on steep descents even at high speeds, more responsive, precise and direct handling, more precision and more stability in technical and rough terrain with better grip and improved overall control.",

Thanks to modern E-Power, you can cover long distances and challenging tours with a few meters of altitude when fully charged. The Ortler Bozen Performance Bosch 9 features the latest generation of Bosch e-bike drives and is equipped with a very powerful 500 watt hour battery from Bosch. The intensity of the pedal force support can be freely selected in four stages and thus the range of the pedelec can be influenced by the rider to the nearest kilometer.Durably equipped with solid Shimano Deore drive technology and a sensitive Suntour suspension fork, the Ortler Bozen Performance leaves nothing to be desired. AXA LED lighting and smooth-running Schwalbe Energizer Active Plus tyres round off the perfect e-bike: Ortler Bozen Performance Bosch Pedelec - intelligent pedelec technology \"Made in Germany\".The Bosch drive: \"Electronic intelligence for superior driver support\" - that's what the BOSCH system says. The perfect symbiosis of drive unit, battery and easy-to-use display turns a conventional bicycle into an intelligent, powerful e-bike. A BOSCH electric bike can be driven like any other bicycle, with support depending on pedal pressure. According to the efficient minimum principle, the motor switches itself off automatically as soon as the rider stops pedalling. Sensors for speed, pedalling force and cadence optimally adjust the engine support to the individual driving behaviour.Due to the low weight of all components and the low mounting of the drive, the Bosch e-bike has an optimal weight distribution, so that even inclines and more demanding stages can be easily pedaled.Details",

The Acid Hybrid ONE combines the go-anywhere rugged appeal of Cube's mountain bikes with the comfort and adaptability of their touring bikes. Sleek, affordable, easy to ride and even easier to slot into your daily life, it's a Bosch e-bike for all reasons - and there's even a trapeze frame version, so everyone can find the perfect fit. The powerful and reliable Bosch Active Line Plus drive unit and battery slot elegantly into the custom aluminium frame, providing smooth, silent assistance for your pedalling. Slick-shifting Shimano 9 speed gears and powerful Shimano MT200 hydraulic disc brakes mean you'll always be able to find the right gear and control your speed safely, while a plush Suntour suspension fork and big, grippy Schwalbe tyres give a comfortable, sure-footed ride. From city streets and the daily commute to weekend off-road exploring, the Acid Hybrid ONE has got it covered.Cube's engineering team puts the same effort into every frame design, whether it's a range-topping race machine or an entry-level commuter. That's why the Acid Hybrid ONE boasts an aluminium superlite chassis with double butted tubes, which shave weight where it isn't needed and add extra thickness where strength is important. Advanced hydroforming is what gives it its sleek looks and the elegant, oversized down tube housing both the Bosch drive unit and the battery. Cube's acclaimed Agile Ride Geometry gives the Acid Hybrid ONE easy, intuitive handling to keep you safe, whether you're exploring a trail or riding to the office. Internally routed cables - including for a future dropper post upgrade - keep everything tidy, reduce maintenance and ensure your gear shifts stay precise. And integrated mudguard mounts mean it's a cinch to fit full length fenders to help keep you dry on the road, all year round.",

The Town Sport Hybrid ONE, that's what: a Bosch e-bike that makes getting around town a pleasure rather than a chore. Urban savvy comes courtesy of the included mudguards, kickstand and luggage carrier. Sporty ride-anywhere ability is provided by the 9 speed transmission and powerful, all-weather hydraulic disc brakes, so you can explore what lies beyond the urban jungle too. The Bosch motor gives you the power you need to easily tackle any hill. And the suspension fork provides comfort on the roughest of rides, while the Easy Entry frame combines great looks with step-through ease. Wherever you need to be, the Town Sport Hybrid ONE will get you there quickly, safely and in comfort.Getting the best out of Bosch's superb drive system takes more than bolting a motor and battery to a frame. Cube's engineers began by positioning the battery behind the triple chamber seat tube, out of the way and in the best location for safe, easy handling. The gravity cast motor mount, exceptionally rigid seat tube and oversized down tube work together to give the Town Sport Hybrid ONE a rigid backbone for efficient pedalling and accurate steering - so you can just concentrate on the ride. Internally routed cables keep gear shifts cleaner for longer and the overall ride experience is as stable and natural as you'd expect, thanks to Cube's Comfort Ride Geometry.

Designed with SRAM's proven XX1 geometry, the PC-X1 features solid pins and 11-speed PowerLock and offers smooth, efficient shifting that you can rely on every time you ride.TechnologiesPowerLockSRAM engineers have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and constant way to connect the 10-speed chains. Although PL does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of a 10-speed drive.X-SyncX-SYNC 1X chainrings from SRAM ensure maximum performance and durability. The long SRAM X-SYNC tooth edges grip the chain earlier than traditional triangular teeth. The sharp and narrow tooth profile as well as the rounded inclined edges support the chain guide. To provide the best possible performance even on muddy terrain, the X-SYNC chainrings have recesses for removing dirt and mud from the inner chain links and rollers. The X-SYNC chainrings manufactured in Germany are an important part of the 1X drive from SRAM.Details",

Although PL does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of an 11-speed drive.X-SYNCX-SYNC 1X chainrings from SRAM ensure maximum performance and durability. The long SRAM X-SYNC tooth edges grip the chain earlier than traditional triangular teeth. The sharp and narrow tooth profile as well as the rounded bevelled edges support the chain guide. In order to provide the best possible performance even in muddy terrain, the X-SYNC chainrings have recesses for removing dirt and mud from the inner chain links and rollers.

                    "description": "The HG901 chain for 11-speed drivetrains is Shimano's premium chain for Dura Ace and XTR drivetrains.Both off-road and on the road, it delivers silky smooth yet precisely defined gearshifts for thousands of kilometres. Shimano has equipped the premium chain for 11-speed systems with special asymmetrical HG-X11 outer and inner plates. This favours a particularly safe guidance of the chainring and at the same time enables more shifting comfort than before. However, it's imperative to make sure during installation that the CN-HG901 is mounted in the correct, fixed running direction. Thanks to Shimano's new Sil-Tec coating, the HG901 chain is extremely low friction and durable. The somewhat higher purchase price is relativised with each kilometre ridden. A real recommendation for demanding frequent riders.Dyna-Sys11The real advantage of the 11-speed drive is that the entire transmission ratio bandwidth is available without having to sacrifice the usual rhythm. Dyna-Sys11 ensures an optimal rhythm with \"Rhythm Step\" courses in the most frequently used range, both on the level and on the ascent. Drive efficiency is a key performance indicator for the powertrain. Dyna-Sys11 means more speed for the same effort.SIL-TECSIL-TEC is Shimano's extremely low friction surface treatment. SIL-TEC is a superior, advanced coating process that improves system performance by using embedded fluorine particles. SIL-TEC products run smoother and show less wear under all conditions.Up-directionalThe CN-HG901 chain has an asymmetrical design. Therefore, the running direction must be observed when mounting. The specially shaped plates optimise the engagement on the sprocket and lead to even smoother shifting processes even under load. To save weight, these chains have recesses on the inner plates and hollow rivet pins. The side with the marking is the outside.Details",

To ensure Pike’s continuing domination of the class, RockShox put it on a weight-loss program, added the new Charger 2 damper, included remote options, and gave it a graphic-package makeover that aligns with the all-new chassis design. Riders will benefit from Pike’s increased steering authority - thanks to Boost-only spacing, stiffness and lighter overall weight - the new friction-reducing DebonAir air spring and the potential to run wider (2.8\") tires.Charger 2 DamperThe evolution of the acclaimed Charger, RockShox’s most advanced damper, brings a whole new level of performance and refinement for each intended use.The new damper designs provides a wider range of low speed compression adjustment in the Open mode, with a more usable Pedal setting that excels on rolling trails. The Firm setting on Pike and Lyrik has been re-tuned, and remote options with OneLoc provide on-the-fly access to the Firm mode and are an excellent match with RockShox Deluxe, Super Deluxe and Super Deluxe Coil remote rear shocks.DebonAirIt’s ok to be soft. DebonAir is not ashamed to give way under the weakest push. In fact, it makes forks and shocks plusher than ever, right from the start. It might seem a weakness, until you take DebonAir to the trail. The connection between your bike and the terrain will be seamless, as your DebonAir equipped fork absorbs every little hit without any harsh feeling on your body. A shock so soft, you can push way harder.Torque CapsTorque Caps make the bond between hub and fork dropout stronger, with an increased surface area connecting the two. This creates a stronger, stiffer interface, giving you a more responsive front wheel and more control. So you concentrate on the most important connection, the one between your bike and the trail.BoostWith revolutionary advancements in bicycle componentry, like SRAM’s XX1, X01 and X1 drivetrains, mountain bike designers have been given almost limitless freedom to focus solely on the performance of the bike. Each advancement demands that the entire package works flawlessly. Aggressive trail and enduro riders have been increasingly enjoying the benefits of larger wheels, but many still view 27.5\" and 29\" wheels as a possible weak link. Which is why SRAM has developed an open standard with Boost compatible components for SRAM drivetrain, hubs and RockShox forks.Details",

And with the addition of its now-standard Motion Control damper, the re-invented Recon is the new silver standard for fun.Air GuidesRockShox print Air Guides on all of our air-sprung forks. Maybe not a technological feat, but it will help you set up your suspension in seconds instead of minutes. And more time on your bike equals more chances to earn King of the Mountain on your favorite trail. Maybe they are a technological feat.Maxle LiteWho obsesses over the weight of their wheel axles? It’s ridiculous, right? It’s just a rod of metal bolting the wheels to your bike. But then again, Maxle Lite is a nifty thru axle system that makes your bike both lighter and stiffer. And less weight makes it easier to get your bike to do what you want. Especially when you don’t need to bring tools to remove it, front or rear. And that extra stiffness gives you the precision to hit your lines no matter how burly. So maybe that obsession isn’t so ridiculous after all. Now available in 20 x 110mm and 15 x 100mm sizes.Motion ControlImagine riding on the moon. Rolling hills, crushed rock blasted out of craters… craters. There’s no gravity so you wouldn’t even need a chairlift. Unfortunately you can’t ride on the moon. There’s lots of gnarly terrain on earth. But, earth has gravity so you’ll need suspension that climbs as well as it descends. With the Motion Control damper technology you’ll do just that.Solo AirSolo Air is like a Buddhist monk. Its enlightened design lets you add air to your forks through a single Schrader valve, filling both the positive and negative air spring chambers simultaneously. So they’re always in perfect equilibrium, like Yin and Yang. Giving you a plush, predictable ride you can set up in seconds, with the lightest weight air spring on the market.Details",

From now on equipped with EVOL air suspension and new stanchions for unrivalled fine response with small strokes, the 36 works even more evenly than before.The exceptionally powerful 36 comes with an even wider choice of damper and axle options, including boost and performance elite models. This has already made it extremely popular with demanding trail bikers and enduro racers.Float Air Spring Patented air transfer port system: The float air suspension system reduces the breakaway torque and thus offers a highly sensitive fork and full comfort even with small impacts. And this for every type of rider and with the most varied air pressure.Similar to the Float suspension struts, the Float suspension system features a positive and a negative air chamber that automatically balance each other out when driving. Every driver thus enjoys the benefits of the correct, precisely balanced air pressure in both air chambers. The progression of the spring characteristic curve can be adjusted with air volume spacers - enabling every driver to precisely adjust the characteristics of the air spring.Kashima CoatingFox spring elements in the Factory versions feature the Kashima coating, which in combination with the inner workings provides a reduced breakaway torque and even softer response.AIR VOLUME SPACERSThe FLOAT air suspension of the Fox forks and struts can be fine-tuned using volume spacers to tune the suspension elements more progressively or less progressively. This allows the driver to fine-tune the suspension exactly to his needs.Details",

                    "description": "The new 32 fork with standard chassis is specially optimised for 120 mm travel and is the lightest suspension fork Fox has ever developed. The new design with the hollow graduation in the immersion tubes allows a slim profile and saves weight without affecting stability and functionality. FIT4Now in its fourth generation, the patented, closed FIT4 damping system (Fox Isolated Technology) equips the rider with three different compression damping positions: Open, Medium and Firm. This allows the damping to be perfectly adapted to changing trail conditions. The Factory Series models are characterised by the broadband low-speed pressure stage adjustment in open mode, which can be adjusted in 22 clicks. This allows the rider to adjust the fork exactly to his or her preferences. The FIT4 damping cartridge has been extensively revised based on the multiple award-winning HSC/LSC damping structure. The result is a significantly more powerful damper in all fork series. This year, Fox has given the FIT4 damper a new tuning, which makes it even more sensitive and at the same time produces a fork that always offers sufficient resistance in rough terrain. GRIPInspired by motocross technology, the GRIP damper cartridge works with a spring-loaded, independently operating floating piston. The GRIP technique allows the excess damping oil to flow through ports at the top of the damper, ensuring even damping and increasing durability. The Performance Series forks have Open, Medium and Firm modes as well as an additional fine-tuning option between these three basic settings. FLOAT AIR SPRINGPatented air transfer port systemThe FLOAT air suspension system reduces the breakaway torque and thus offers a highly sensitive fork and full comfort even with small impacts. This applies for all types of riders and at varying air pressures. Similar to the FLOAT suspension struts, the FLOAT suspension system is characterised by positive and negative air chambers, which automatically balance each other out when riding. Every rider therefore enjoys the benefits of the correct, precisely balanced air pressure in both air chambers. The progression of the spring characteristic curve can be adjusted with the air volume spacers - enabling every driver to precisely adjust the characteristics of the air spring. AIR VOLUME SPACERSThe FLOAT air suspension of the Fox forks and struts can be fine-tuned using volume spacers to make the suspension elements more or less progressive. This allows the rider to fine-tune the suspension exactly to his or her needs. Details",

                    "description": "The RockShox Judy Silver adds new features to the benefits of boost technology, such as compatibility with 2.8\" tires on 27.5\" or 29\" models, and offers proven RockShox technologies such as the Solo Air spring and the easy-to-use Lockout TurnKey damper. Maxle LiteWho is compulsively concerned with the weight of their wheel axles? That's ridiculous, isn't it? It's just a metal bar that attaches the wheels to your bike. On the other hand, Maxle Lite is a sophisticated thru axle system that makes your bike lighter and stiffer, and a lighter bike is easier to control. The Maxle also allows wheel removal without tools, both at the front and at the back. The extra stiffness gives you the precision you need to master the rockiest of paths. So maybe this obsession isn't so ridiculous after all. Solo AirSolo Air is like a Buddhist monk. The enlightened design allows the positive and negative air chambers of your suspension forks to be filled with air simultaneously via just one car valve. So there is a perfect balance between them, like Yin and Yang. For a comfortable and predictable ride, you can adjust the lightest suspension fork on the market in seconds. Torque CapsTorque Caps strengthen the connection between the hub and the fork dropout by increasing the surface area that connects the two. This creates a stronger and stiffer interface that gives you better feedback and more control. So you can concentrate on the most important connection: The one between your bike and the trail. TurnKeyThis exclusive technology is your personal bodyguard. When you ride over a big rock with your suspension fork locked, TurnKey's patented blow-off design catches the ball for you and absorbs the unexpected blow in an instant. Compatible with PushLoc and PopLoc remote controls. BOOSTBOOST is a new wheel and component specification that offers improved frame geometry with shorter chainstays, wider and harder suspension, a greater number of chainring options, more room for wider tyres and increased wheel stiffness and robustness.

The saddle -  with its wave-like shape and raised rear -  provides a perfect rear hold and an optimal pressure distribution down to the deep structures of the body. Meaning,  the power transmission to the pedal is considerably improved. The deeper nose combined with the deepening in the middle creates more room and free space for the dam area. The flat yet slim SQlab MaxContact saddle nose and the tight padding of the 612 were optimally adapted to the needs of the road bike. SQlab ErgowaveThe new form of the SQlab step saddle for sporty sitting positions on mountain bikes and road bikes. Provides optimum pressure distribution around the sit bones - for even better performance and comfort. SQlab MaxContactThe flattened, narrow saddle nose offers a much larger contact surface and thus a greater pressure distribution than conventional saddles Details",

It has been precisely adapted to the needs of off-road use as well as to the requirements of all-mountain and enduro riding. The saddle's wave-like shape and raised rear provide perfect rear support and optimum pressure distribution down to the deep structures of the body, which significantly improves power transmission to the pedal. The lower lying nose in combination with the deepening in the middle creates more space for the dam area. The saddle nose of the 611 is approx. 4 mm wider than that of the 612 for even better pressure relief, especially on longer ascents in off-road terrain, but is just as flat and designed with as large a contact surface as possible. The upholstery material was specially adapted to the MTB requirements and has more damping in rough terrain than the 612 ERGOWAVE models. High-quality Kevlar cover protects the particularly stressed areas on the saddle. The SQlab active saddle technology allows the saddle to follow the pedalling movement, increasing comfort, mobilising the intervertebral discs and minimising pressure on the seat bones.Details",

Meaning,  the power transmission to the pedal is considerably improved. The deeper nose combined with the deepening in the middle creates more room and free space for the dam area.

Provides optimum pressure distribution around the sit bones - for even better performance and comfort.

The sporty active saddles are equipped with three different elastomer dampers, which are individually adjusted to the body weight and can be replaced as required.

Up, down, whatever the trail requires. The advantage of the X-Glide drive is obvious, but if you think about it more carefully, it has an enormous effect on your driving experience. Error-free shifting means you never have to compromise on your speed and power on unpredictable off-road terrain. And this is how it all works: TRUVATIV's crank engineers have thrown the old standards overboard and developed a new chainring geometry from scratch. They have matched the chainrings of different sizes exactly to each other and reworked the points where the chain and chainring meet. By matching the teeth of the chainring to the link pins of the chain (instead of the centre of the chainring) you get twice as many shifting options. You'll never shift into the wrong gear again. With X-Glide you will always find the right gear.JetThe cassette with its black JET finish not only looks good, it also offers optimal performance on every ride. The JET finish offers higher corrosion resistance.Mini ClusterThe hybrid construction of the Mini Cluster cassette combines three small pinions, CNC milled from a single steel block, with another eight pinions, which are put together individually. The result: a lightweight and robust 10-42 cassette that is ideal for any trip.",

With the latest and completely revised version of the DEOREXT Group, the Japanese manufacturer takes your shifting performance to a new level. The new XT group meets the most diverse requirements of cross-country bikers, trail bike fans or enduro racers equally convincingly and presents itself as the most universal high-performance shifting group from the Japanese experts.The DEORE XT RD-M8000 rear derailleur has optimised SHADOW+ technology with a flat angle of attack and an extremely flat profile to keep sensitive components out of the danger zone. The shifting capacity was optimised for diagonally running chains using newly designed pulleys. You also have the option of setting the mechanism for minimum operating forces or maximum stability. The DEORE XT derailleur enables precise and lightning-fast gear changes when you need them and guides the chain safely - even on the roughest trails. Enduro fans can also do without an additional chain guide because the Shimano Clutch System keeps the chain under high tension.The new DEORE XT rear derailleur is suitable for regular double use due to its large capacity as well as for bikers who only want to get by with one front chainring and 11 sprockets on the rear wheel.",

The larger, 14-tooth X-SYNC lower pulley, allows 10- to 50-tooth cassette capacity in this compact design, and also adds to Eagle’s overall smooth-pedaling feel. The new Type-3 ROLLER BEARING CLUTCH features a smoother torque curve for a quieter, more consistent operation and feel. CAGE LOCK has been moved back and out of the way, protecting it from trail debris. A redesigned, robust mounting system further improves the Eagle derailleur’s performance and overall durability.CAGE LOCKWith CAGE LOCK technology in the rear derailleur, wheel removal and installation - as well as chain installation—becomes faster and simpler. Just pushing the cage forward to create slack and lock it into place.ROLLER BEARING CLUTCHROLLER BEARING CLUTCH rear derailleurs deliver maximum drivetrain stability - even through the most punishing terrain. With ROLLER BEARING CLUTCH technology, derailleur bounce and chain slap are eliminated without sacrificing precision.X-ACTUATIONDeveloped specifically for SRAM 1X, X-ACTUATION keeps shifting sharp and consistent across the entire 10- to 42-tooth cassette.X-HORIZONThe X-HORIZON rear derailleur’s ‘straight parallelogram’ design limits all movement to the horizontal axis, which makes ghost shifting impossible while also reducing shift force. For quicker, more exact shifting, the large upper pulley offset design maintains a constant chain gap across all gears.Details",

AXS allows you to easily personalize the groupset right from your phone and enable your choices while riding. Orbit technology offers next-level chain management for all the places a drop bar bike can go.AXSAXS is SRAM's new electronic integration platform that combines electronic bicycle components and software. The SRAM AXS app allows riders to view battery status, change component behavior, adjust controls, receive maintenance reminders and firmware updates.X-Range Racing bikes are faster and more powerful than ever before and riders keep showing what bikes with racing handlebars are capable of. X-Range offers a wider range of gear ratios, as well as an even more pleasant and usable gear gradation... and also has smart, programmable shift settings thanks to AXS.OrbitOrbit technology is an innovative new form of rear derailleur motion control. It uses silicone fluid as part of an elegant and ultra-light damping system. Compared to a conventional friction clutch system, Orbit technology produces no additional resistance to the rear derailleur spring during slow or light movement. This means easier shifting and rear wheel removal. During the ride, the fluid damper holds the chain back in a refined and elegant way. With maximum reliability and chain tension, for 2-fold and 1-fold systems.Details",

If a vehicle approaches, the bicycle radar warns the cyclist acoustically and visually via the connected display unit or a compatible Garmin product (Edge or Wearable). The slim and aerodynamic Varia RTL511 can be mounted without tools on the seat post of racing, touring or city bikes. The battery life of up to 10 hours also allows longer tours.A sensor you can rely on  When cycling, you need to keep an eye on everything. Which way do you go, how far does it take you, how fast do you ride and how strongly do you challenge yourself? But the most important thing is to keep an eye on your own safety. Having eyes in the back of your bike helmet may be a little unrealistic. That's exactly how you can imagine Varia. The radar is like an early warning system that increases your safety when cycling.The more, the saferThe Varia RTL511 radar represents only part of the available bicycle safety products. When paired with compatible Garmin devices, the system helps improve cycling safety. For this purpose, a warning is issued for vehicles approaching from behind. Green light? It's all right. Yellow light? There's a vehicle approaching. Red light? Attention! A vehicle is approaching at high speed. Ride safe!Details",

The radar rear light also warns approaching vehicles of a cyclist ahead. Works independently or integrates seamlessly with compatible Edge cycling computers. Edge computer or Varia head unit can show multiple approaching vehicles and indicates the relative speed of approach and threat level.Getting Hit From Behind Is A Leading Cause Of Cycling FatalitiesThe threat is real. That’s why getting some extra help knowing what’s sneaking up behind you is an important breakthrough. You already use caution and check over your shoulder, especially before making turns, but Varia radar gives you an important tool by watching behind you even when you aren’t.Varia Bike Lights Are Smarter Than The Typical Bike LightThe Varia line of cycling awareness products also includes Varia smart headlights and rear lights. When paired with select Edge bike computers, these bike lights help to create safer riding conditions by adjusting the beam focus point according to a bike’s speed and matching brightness to changing light conditions. As speed increases, the headlight focuses further down the road to project light to where it’s needed most and brings it closer as you slow. As ambient light fades or gets brighter, both the headlight and rear light adjust automatically when paired with a light-sensing Edge 1000 bike computer.Details",

The powerful Battery Pack and the super-light Remote with fluorescent buttons are included. With a burning time of between 2.5 and 20 hours, the helmet light is your indispensable companion for every night rideAs the name suggests, 2000 lumens are contained in the BUSTER 2000 HL power package. And this with a burning time of up to 20 hours. Three CREE LEDs ensure constant light output for perfectly illuminated trails and pathsSeven light modesWith seven different modes, the lighting intensity can be ideally regulated. The four continuous light modes \"Eco\" (300 lumen), \"Standard\" (600 lumen), \"Power\" (1300 lumen) and \"High Power\" (2000 lumen) allow the driver to choose the burning time. For more attention on the trail the three flashing modes \"Flash\", \"Pulse\" and \"SOS\" serveFlexible mountingTwo holder systems are included in the scope of delivery. The universal helmet holder adapts flexibly to all common helmet models. In addition, there is an adapter that can be connected to the holder of Action Cams. Remote ControlThe BUSTER 2000 HL is even easier to operate with the 14 gram light and compact Remote. Particularly practical when the light is attached to the helmet. The wireless remote control is quickly attached to the handlebars via an O-ring and can be found quickly even in the dark thanks to fluorescent keys. It operates with an interference-free 2.4 GHz signal. Battery Pack = PowerbankThe Panasonic cells built into the battery pack provide an output of 6400 mAh. The current charge status of the battery can be directly read off via the four-stage indicator. A USB port also allows you to charge other devices such as a bike computer or smartphone.High-quality housingThe BUSTER 2000 HL owes its timeless and elegant design to the anodised aluminium housing. The surface is also resistant to scratchesGlow in the darkBoth the control button of the lamp and the two large buttons of the wireless remote fluoresce and can therefore be easily seen in the dark.Practical plug-in systemThe design of the plug-in connection has been improved and simplifies the separation and connection of light and battery pack. This significantly reduces the risk of cable breaks. Power to goThe silicone holder with the two silicone straps ensures fast, secure and above all scratch-free attachment of the battery pack to the frame.Power MonitorAt the touch of a button you can see the current state of charge of the battery pack. The four LEDs each indicate 25% of the capacity. Other devices can also be charged via the USB port.Remote ControlDouble-click the upper button to switch on the BUSTER 2000 HL. The helmet light is switched off again by holding the button down for a longer time. Use the upper keys to change between the three flashing modes. The lower button switches through the four continuous light modes.Details",

This discharges a strong, sustained blast of air, which quickly brings tubeless systems to a sitting position. Accurate analog display. Durable steel and aluminium construction with stylish wooden handle. Extra long, nylon reinforced fabric hose. Presta and Schrader valve compatible ABS1 Pro valve clamp. If you want to use a Pressure Over Drive as a regular pump, there must first be air in the chamber before it can fill an empty tyre. This may take a few strokes before the tyre begins to fill. If it is only a matter of continuing to inflate a tube/tyre, the chamber must first have the same pressure as the tyre before it can release air and continue to inflate the tyre. Details",

This increases the efficiency of the pedals noticeably and they are particularly suitable for use in the MTB Cross Country or Cross Country Race.The pedals come with the SM-SH51 Cleats as usual from Shimano. The pedal body is made of anodised aluminum and the pedal axle of CrMo. The compact bearing is of course sealed. Matching shoe plates are included in the scope of delivery. Also in the new edition, the XT click pedals are reliable and almost indestructible classics for dedicated mountain bikers and, as usual from Shimano, slightly better than their predecessors.Details",

In order to further optimise power transmission and the life of the pedal, this surface is made of stainless steel and is shaped into the pedal body.LightweightAt only 130 g, the Keo 2 Max is one of the lightest pedals in its category. This is due to the use of composites that allow weight savings without affecting resistance.ReliabilityParticular attention has been paid to reliability: Composite body, INOX contact surface, oversize axle and double density make this pedal a particularly safe and durable product.Thanks to the new axle design of the Keo 2 Max, the contact height can be maintained while using an oversize titanium axle. It consists of 2 miniature ball bearings (12 mm inside x 18 mm outside) and a needle bearing. LOOK axles are only released after a rotational test of 1 million cycles at 100 rpm with a load of 90 kg on the centre of the pedal and an eccentric rotation (one shock at each revolution). This test exceeds the highest applicable standard in this area: EN standard EN14781.A double seal guarantees a particularly long service life of the bearings.Setting the Q-factorThanks to its 14 mm long thread, the new LOOK axis allows the Q-factor to be set to 2 mm with the aid of a specific spacer, which is available as an individual part. This allows a change from 53 to 55 mm.Details",

                    "description": "Better performanceBetter, smarter and connected on the go - with the Vector 3-Watt Pedal System. If you want to beat your personal best in your next competition or Gran Fondo, past performance data is always the most reliable way to estimate your future performance. Unlike other power meters, the Vector 3's sensors are located directly in the pedals, so you get reliable data every time you train.Better training planning with Cycling DynamicsWith the Vector 3 system with dual sensor, the performance of the right and left leg is stored independently of each other. The Vector 3 measures overall performance, cadence and power distribution from left and right. It also records advanced Cycling Dynamics so you can adapt your workout to your personal weaknesses and strengths to improve your performance. The device also stores when and how long you have spent standing or sitting. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of the respective position. You can also see the power phase, which shows you when the positive riding force begins and ends in the pedal cycle. The Platform Center Offset indicates where the force is applied to the pedal so you can be sure that the cleat is positioned correctly. Edge Bicycle Computer and Garmin Connect Mobile App.Easy to assemble, change and use  With the Vector 3, you don't have to disassemble or reassemble any other components and save yourself the trouble of installing additional sensors. Therefore the Vector 3 is installed like any other pedal. Mounting on different bicycles is also very simple. Ergonomics were also carefully considered during the development with a beautifully shaped design. The precision stainless steel axle and composite pedal body are specially manufactured and tested for durability. The device has a battery life of up to 120 hours.Connected BikeYour workouts will be even more effective if you pair the Vector 3 with compatible Edge bike computers, ANT+ or Bluetooth enabled fitness devices, including compatible Forerunner and fēnix devices, and the Garmin Connect Mobile app. These devices also enable trouble-free software updates. After the training Garmin Connect, Strava and TrainingPeaks come into play. There you can analyse your data, share it with others, view it on a map, plan routes and more. Use ANT+ connectivity to get better results by pairing the Vector 3 with TrainerRoad. The TrainerRoad app provides individually adapted indoor training based on performance data from Vector 3. The indoor training system also has training plans with precise instructions on how to achieve your specific fitness and competition goals. This is what structured training looks like in its best form.Details",

Used by enduro professionals like Jerome Clementz and Jared Graves, the Enduro Race T1 proves with their placings that the HT clipless pedals with their flat design and compact aluminium platform can do more than just look good.  The CNC-machined pedal uses its own clipless pedal mechanism with its own (supplied) cleats. Spring tension is finely adjustable and platform has additional pins unique in this class to provide maximum control when clicked in or out. The Ti version with titanium pedal axle at a lightweight 328 grams marks the top of the Enduro Race T1 pedals from HT. Details",
